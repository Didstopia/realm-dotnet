It uses the top-rated NuGet package [Json.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/newtonsoft.json/) to provide parsing.


## Build Notes

`JSONimport` was created using the Xamarin Studio 6 template _Multiplatform Forms App (Portable)_. 

It uses the Realm NuGet package as well as the Json.NET mentioned above.
